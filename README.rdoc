Hey creeps! These are couple PHP scripts that make it rather simple to display who is currently online on your Minecraft server.

== users.php

This script parses your server.log file generated by your Minecraft server and tells you:

  Who is online or offline
  When they were last logged on
  Displays the actual face from their Minecraft skin (generated by avatar.php)

Just throw this file on a webserver, along with your server.log file. As a short-term solution, I simply threw my server.log into a Public Dropbox folder. See my server here: http://caseypugh.com/minecraft

== avatar.php

This script magically pulls out the face of your Minecraft.net into a new PNG image of specified size.

Here's my current skin: http://minecraft.net/skin/Shamestamps.png
After running it through avatar.php: http://caseypugh.com/minecraft/avatar/Shamestamps?size=100
